# streamlining_school_data

This compile_data.py file will take multiple csv files, clean and reorganize the data into a single pandas dataframe. Each row of the final dataframe will contain all relevant numbers and data points for a single student and the final output will be either a csv file or excel spreadsheet.

The raw student data is not provided for privacy purposes.
